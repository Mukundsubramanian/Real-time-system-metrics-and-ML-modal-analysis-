Real Time System Monitoring and Training Progress Visualisations for High-Performance Computing Systems(HPCs)


  In Machine Learning and High Performance computing environments, it is crucial to monitor system performance, hardware usage and the efficiency of ongoing training process. This webpage gives a dynamic and an interactive interface that can present real-time data, historical trends and provides insights into cruicial system components such as CPU, GPU Utilisation, memory usage, HBM memory usage, log information and many more. 


The Webpage we provide offers: 

- Monitors and visualises live system datas (System logs, CPU, GPU performance, Storage details)

- Analyses the CPU, GPU utilizations, HBM Memory usage, and other critical hardware informations

- Visualises the real time machine learning training efficiency with progress bars and allow time iteration (forward and backward) to review system performance and log data over time.

  The ML Model we provide analyses the CPU, GPU performances, Memory usage, and other important system datas. The model points out anomalies in the live data and predict the performances in the near future. It also gives a summary of the live datas and gives a trend seen in the existing live data. It also gives a cluster graph.
